Ideally, one could allow students to work on WIMS and get scores whenever and wherever they like. However, it is impossible for the server to check the physical presence of the student, nor who is typing on the keyboard.
<p>
As a teacher, you must be aware that if you allow people to get scores on WIMS without checking physical presence, there will certainly be students asking others to work for them. Even if you are willing to tolerate this kind of ``cheating'', this will make the WIMS scores unusable administratively because honest students will protest.
<p>
The solution we have found for this problem in

!read primitives.phtml 1, link, experience, our experience 
 is to allow students to work on the assignments whenever and whereever they like, but score registrations are open only during computer-room sessions where the teacher is present.
<p>
Even in this case, we have found a tiny minority of students asking friends to login to their accounts simultaneously during the sessions (on another workstatioin), to get scores for them. For this reason,  no score will be counted by WIMS when simultaneous logins are present (so that students cheating in this way will get penalty in return, as they lose their own work).
