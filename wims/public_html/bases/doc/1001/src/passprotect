This problem is very real when you (supervisor) have to login within a computer room, amid student workstations.

You may have to do this for several reasons: a student may forget his/her login name or password, and ask you to recover his/her account; you may want to check student progress in real time, or change the setup of a worksheet (open/close), etc.

Please be aware that for your students, your personal password is a very coveted object. Everyone is convinced that the teacher can change his/her score, even if you tell them that this is not true. They may look over your shoulders when you type your password, or even install a keyboard scanning program on the workstation you are to use.

Well it is true that even the supervisor cannot change the server-computed scores. However, if ever a student succeeds in stealing your password, he can do a lot of dammage to the virtual class, starting from changing the very supervisor's password (so that HE becomes the supervisor, and you lose control to your class).

For this reason, the use of one-time passwords and/or the definition of secure hosts are highly recommended. Please refer to the help pages of the virtual class configuration tool (accessible from the front page of supervisor's login) for more details.
