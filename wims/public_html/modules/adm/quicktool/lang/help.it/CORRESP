$wims_name_quick_CORRESP type exercises are matching exercises.
A list of 3 (or N number of) items (words, audio recordings, pictures) 
and matching items (words, audio recordings, pictures) are randomly selected from 
among the data set.
<p class="emptyline"></p>
Audio recordings from the swac audio collection can be included in matching exercises. 
If you wish to include audio recordings from the swac audio collection, you have to first 
check if the recording is available in the swac collection. If it is, 
use the following format for the item in the matching exercise 
<tt> audio="word"</tt> or <tt>audio="expression"</tt>. 
Be careful to use the same spelling that is provided in the swac audio collection, 
otherwise QUICKTOOL will not recognise the word or expression.
<p class="emptyline"></p>
The size of the labels can be modified (for example when you have long sentences as an item) 
by changing the parameters in V x LG x LD ( height, width of left column, width of right column)

<span class="wims_warning">$wims_name_remark</span>: Preferences for a data set.
If you wish to add a different audio recording, a different title (i.e. text) 
or a different introduction to each data set (i.e. exercise), the first line 
must have the following format

<pre>
:audio=audio_file.mp3 image=picture_file.jpg title="your text" intro="instructions"
</pre>
Each individual item in the data set (i.e. in the exercise) can be either a word 
(or several words), an audio recording or a picture. 
If you wish to use different audio recordings or pictures as items, the following format is required
 <tt>"nameofrecordingfile.mp3"</tt> if your file is in the <tt>images</tt> folder
or <tt>"audio="word"</tt> ; in this latter case the software program will first check 
if the file
<tt>word.mp3</tt> is in the <tt>images</tt> folder, if it is not, the software 
program will retrieve it from the swac audio recordings data base.
If you do not wish to add an audio recording, a title ... in the data set the first 
line of the data set 
(i.e. the line following :) must be left blank.
<p class="emptyline"></p>
In the example below the audio recording called <tt>father.mp3</tt> must be in the
<tt>images</tt> folder (notice the blank line)

<pre>
:
mère,audio=mother
soeur,audio=sister
frère,father.mp3
</pre>

<pre>
:instruction="my instructions"
mère,audio=mother
soeur,audio=sister
frère,father.mp3
