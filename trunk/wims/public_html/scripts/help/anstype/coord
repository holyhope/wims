:Syntax,Meaning

:point,x,y
Point at (x,y). It is a ``fat'' point, with fixed width.

:bound,FNAME,x,y
bound defined in the image file FNAME, which must be of the same size as the clicked image (but can be a different image).
The condition is met if (x,y) is in the same fill zone as the user click.
If <span class="tt">fill</span> is in the option field of the reply, the zone is filled in red or green (instead of a ball).
<span class="wims_warning">$wims_name_warning</span>. If the exercise is in a class, the image NOMFIC should be copied  :
<pre>\text{cache=draw(\size[1],\size[2]
copy 0,0,-1,-1,-1,-1,NOMFIC)}
\text{cache = slib(oef/insfilename)}
</pre>
In a module, it is sufficient to write its name.

Two options are available:
<ul><li>
 <span class="tt wims_code_words">fill</span> : the zone is filled instead of
  indicated by a ball in the answer (do not use in the case where an
  auxiliary image FNAME has been used).
</li><li>
 <span class="tt wims_code_words">goodanswershown</span>: show the good answer
  on the image in case of bad answer.
</li></ul>
:bound,FNAME
as above, but the condition is met if the user click has DIFFERENT color than the pixel on the upper-left corner of FNAME.
