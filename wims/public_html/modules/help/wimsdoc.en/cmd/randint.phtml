mean:Returns a random integer between `n1' and `n2' (inclusive). <br/>\
  Substitution and evaluation are done on `n1' and `n2' before applying random. <br/>\
  If `n2' is missing, returns random integer between $(m_pm)1 and `n1' (inclusive). <br/>\
  If both `n1' and `n2' are missing, returns 0.\

  You can also type <span class="tt">!randint `n1, n2' repeat `i'</span> to repeatedly generate\
  `i' random integers.
