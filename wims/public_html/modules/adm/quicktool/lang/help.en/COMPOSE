$wims_name_quick_COMPOSE type exercises require the learner to put words or word groups in order.
If you want to add commas or semicolons use their html code instead 
(&amp;#44; for the comma and  &amp;#59; for the semicolon).
<p class="emptyline"></p>
29 data sets (i.e. sentences) are allowed in each exercise. 
:format
<pre>
:The cat /is / eating/a mouse.

If you wish to add a different audio recording, a different title (i.e. text) 
or a different introduction to each data set (i.e. exercise), 
the first line must have the following format

<pre>
:audio=audio_file.mp3 image=picture_file.jpg title="your text" intro="instructions"
