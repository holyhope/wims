 The \special method "help" accepts two parameters. The first is a key 
 which will be put to the variable \help_subject within the help text, 
 and the second is the text of the link.
 
 If the \special{help} is put into statement or feedback of an exercise, 
 the help will use popup mode, unlike the usual "help" link in the module.

 All the help content should be put into the oef source. No facility is 
 planned for module-level help, as the principle is that the independency 
 of oef files should not be destroyed by helps. However, if you have 
 several exercises sharing the same help texts, you may consider using cpp.

<b>Example:</b>
 <pre>
 \title{Guess}
 \statement{ Guess a word :  
   \special{help test1,First clue}
 }
 \answer{1}{Monk}
 \help{
   This is the help: help subject=\help_subject
   <p>
   \if{\help_subject issametext or \help_subject issametext none}{
     \special{help test0,here}
   }
   \if{\help_subject issametext test1}{
     The first letter is <b>M</b>. You can find another clue
     \special{help test2,here}
   }
  \if{\help_subject issametext test2}{Here is the second clue. 
    The second letter is <b>o</b>
   }
  \if{\help_subject issametext test0}{Here is the  
    \special{help test1,clue 1}, \special{help test2,clue 2}
   }
 }
