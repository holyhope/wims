 <li class="wims_browse_list">
  !href module=tool/geometry/animtrace Tracés animés
  , an online plotter which plots animated curves and surfaces. Enter your 
  equations with a parameter, and get your curves or surfaces which 
  zoom, rotate, deform, ... Contains a demo page with several prepared examples.
  <p>
  And the tool
  !href module=tool/geometry/polyray Polyray
  lets you enter an implicit equation, and plots a ray-traced surface, also
  with the possibility of animation.
  Very pleasant to the eyes, but a bit slower.
 
</li><li class="wims_browse_list">
  !href module=tool/analysis/function Function calculator:
  enter your function, and click to get most of
  what you would want to know about this function: integrals, derivatives,
  limits, roots, extrema, graph, Taylor, etc. <p>
  In a similar fashion, there is a
  !href module=tool/linear/matrix Matrix calculator
  giving you most of what you would want to know about your matrix: 
  determinant, inverse, characteristic polynomial, eigenvalues and
  eigenvectors, etc.
 
</li><li class="wims_browse_list">
  !href module=tool/geometry/rulecomp Ruler &amp; Compass
  makes simulation of ruler and compass geometric constructions, including
  dozens of predefined goals with solutions and hints.

</li><li class="wims_browse_list">
  !href module=tool/algebra/factor Factorizor
  of integers and polynomials, powerful and easy to use. It factors integers
  of around 50 digits within seconds. You may also choose the base field
  for your factorization of polynomials: $m_QQ, $m_RR, $m_CC, or even prime
  finite fields.

  Some online games:
  !href module=H2/algebra/bargame Bar game

  !href module=H3/algebra/spuzzle Shifting puzzle
  .  
</li><li class="wims_browse_list">
  !href module=H5/geometry/gravshoot Gravity shoot
  is another graphical exercise which gives you some points and asks you
  to click on the gravity center of the points. Your score depends on the
  precision of your clicks, as in a shooting gallery.
