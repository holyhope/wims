 <b>Finite set (literal, formal and approximative).</b>
 (names: <span class="tt">set</span>, <span class="tt">fset</span> and <span class="tt">aset</span>) <br/>
 This is a list of (literal) elements separated by commas, 
 where the order is not important. 
 <p>
 
 for <span class="tt">set</span>, no evaluation is done to the elements (so that 2 and 1+1
 are not the same element). If <span class="tt">repeat</span> is a word of option, the elements
 must be with repetition as in the good answer. Otherwise, the answer is only 
 partially good.

 <p>
 For <span class="tt">fset</span>, the elements are evaluated as
 <em>formal expressions</em>.

 <p>
 For <span class="tt">aset</span>, the elements are evaluated as
 <em>approximative expressions</em>.
