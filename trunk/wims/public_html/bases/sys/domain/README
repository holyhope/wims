If you want to add a keyword (technical word) in the file domain,
you must put it  in the hierarchy (check before that an equivalent does not
exist).

To update the files domain.xx, execute the script mkdomain.pl in the directory
wims/public_html/bases/sys/  then compare the files
domain/domain.xx and domain/domain.xx.tmp for the language xx you want to
translate and add the missing lines in domain/domain.xx and the translation
if necessary
