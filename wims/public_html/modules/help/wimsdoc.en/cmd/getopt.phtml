syntax:!getopt `name' in `string'
mean:This command allows to extract the definition of a word in `string' under the form `name=value'.\
  <p>\
  It returns the defined `value' in the string, or the `name' itself if it appears in `string'\
  but if there is no `=' sign following it, or an empty string if `name' does not appear \
  in `string' as a word.\
  </p><p>\
  `value' can be a multi-word string, if it is enclosed by a pair of parentheses, brackets, \
  curly braces or double quotes. The enclosing parentheses etc. will be removed from the output.\
  </p><p>\
  Spaces are allowed before and/or after the `=' sign.\
  </p>
