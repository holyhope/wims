 <b>Number.</b> (name: <span class="tt wims_code_words">numeric</span>)<br/>
 Comparison of real numbers up to the precision defined by the author.
<p>
Precision can be fixed in the field
<span class="tt wims_code_words">precision</span>,
by default 1000.
The error is by default relative : the difference between the good answer and the
reply should be less in absolute value than
<span class="tt">M(prec)</span>
where
<div class="wimscenter">
!insmath M(prec)= \frac{max(|\mbox{reply}|+|\mbox{goodreply}|,\frac{1}{\mbox{prec}})}{\mbox{prec}}
</div>
(replace
 <span class="tt">precision</span> by <span class="tt">sqrt(precision)</span>
for a good answer up to precision).
</p>
:option
<p>
If the word <span class="tt wims_code_words">comma</span> is in the option,
real numbers can be written with
a comma instead of the decimal point (but the good answer must be with a
decimal point). In this case, if the answer is bad, the good answer is written
with the same "decimal point" as the one of the student.
</p>
<p>
If the word <span class="tt wims_code_words">absolute</span> is in the option, the precision is absolute.
The answer is then good up to precision if the difference is less than 10/precision.
