<h3>Using a document block for worksheet presentation</h3>

You may put the address of a document block
(such as <span class="tt wims_fname">c1/main</span>) to be the presentation page of the work sheet.
The document itself need not be readable by participants.
<p>Leave this field blank if you want to use the standard presentation page.</p>
<p>
Links to individual exercises should be defined using the command
    <span class="tt wims_code_variable">\exercise</span>.</p>
You can use the following pre-defined variables:
<ul>
 <li><span class="tt wims_code_variable">\scorerequire</span> Required points of each exercise
 </li><li><span class="tt wims_code_variable">\scoregot</span> Participant's point achievements on each exercise
 </li><li><span class="tt wims_code_variable">\scoremean</span> Participant's average score on each exercise
 </li><li><span class="tt wims_code_variable">\expiration</span> Expiration date of the sheet, yyyymmdd
 </li><li><span class="tt wims_code_variable">\today</span> Date of today, yyyymmdd</li>
</ul>
<p>All the score parameters are lists of numbers, each member of the list
corresponding to the number for an exercise of the sheet.</p>

<b>For example</b>, if you are creating worksheet number 5, write the following instructions
in the </tt>c1/main</tt> block of the document:
<pre>
\exercise{5/1} : Score required: \scorerequire[1]
                 Score obtained: \scoregot[1]

\exercise{5/2} : Score required: \scorerequire[2]
                 Score obtained: \scoregot[2]

\exercise{5/3}{Un autre titre}: Score required \scorerequire[3]
                Score obtained: \scoregot[3]
</pre>
