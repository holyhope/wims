3, number of significative digits\
 , optional: order of magnitude of the digit before the decimal dot; only valid if the quantity is dimensionless, just a number with no unit.\
 , optional: the desired physical unit to show (possibly a multiple or sub-multiple).
slib_out=the physical quantity with the right number of digits, or a numeric value which would be equal to the result with the right number of digits.
slib_comment=the default means: 1 meter with three significative digits. The last example shows how the numeric value may lack some trailing zeros after the dot.<p><b>Known bug:</b><br>if the third parameter is used, the output may have a wrong syntax. Ensure that the resulting number has its decimal dot near its significant digits.
