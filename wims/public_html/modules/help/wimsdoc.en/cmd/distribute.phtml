  according to the word `type'. `type' can be one of the following: `words', `items', \
  `lines', `chars'. <p> For example, if `type' is <span class="tt">words</span>, \
  then the first (resp. second, etc.) variable in `namelist' will be set\
  to the first (resp. second, etc.) word of `string'.</p>
