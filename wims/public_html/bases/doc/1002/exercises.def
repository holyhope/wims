Exercises on WIMS are much more powerful than their counterparts found on most other systems.
<p>
Instead of limiting user replies to multiple choices, WIMS can accept various types of inputs, including freestyle input that it is able to recognize as a number, a function, a matrix, a sentence, etc. Moreover, no syntax requirement is necessary in these inputs, so that any reasonably recognizable input is correctly recognized. And distinctions can be made between typing errors and a wrong answer. These answers can be analyzed using various

 instead of compared with a standard answer. Multi-step interactions can also be built into these exercises.
<p>
The most important feature of WIMS exercises is their capability of random variations. They are generally always dynamic, that is, at each new request, a new exercise is generated and presented. Sophisticated softwares can be used to generate such variations.
<p>
Exercises with random variations are very important in that they can support multiple repetitions by users (students), thus helping the comprehension. Combined with solid anti-cheating mechanisms, they provide also a means for a highly reliable and entirely automatic evaluation system using

, under which one can even publish the content of an examination BEFORE the latter takes place.
