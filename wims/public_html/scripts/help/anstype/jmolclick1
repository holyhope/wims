:Syntax,Explanations
:atomno=1 
the atom number 1
:({1})
the atom number 2 (attention au décalage de 1).
:atomno=1 or atomno=2 or atomno=5
the atoms 1, 2 and 5
:({0 1 4})
the atoms 1, 2 and 5 (pay attention at the shift of 1).
:({0 1 4:7})
the atoms 1, 2 and the atoms from 5 to 8 (pay attention at the shift of 1).
:_C
all the atoms de carbone (one can also write <tt>carbon</tt> or use the atomic number <tt>elemno=6</tt>)
:connected(2)
all the atoms with two bonds (whatever the type of bonds)
:connected(2,4)
all the atoms with 2 and 4 bonds (for all types of bonds)
:connected(double)
all the atoms with a double bond (one can also ask <tt>single</tt>, <tt>triple</tt> or <tt>aromatic</tt>)
:connected(atomno=5)
all the atoms connected to the atom number 5
:connected(2,nitrogen)
all the atoms connected exactly to two nitrogen atoms (they may be connected to other atoms types)
:within(2.1,atomno=4)
all the atoms to a distance less than 2.1 Å from the atom number 4
:within(2.1,plane,@{plane({atomno=3},{atomno=4},{atomno=5})})
all the atoms to a distance less than 2.1 Å of the plane defined by the atoms number 3, 4 and 5 (it is an algebraic measure)
:within(2.1,plane,@{plane({atomno=3},{atomno=4},{atomno=5})}) or within(-2.1,plane,@{plane({atomno=3},{atomno=4},{atomno=5})})
all the atoms to a distance less than 2.1 Å of the plane defined by the atoms number 3, 4 and 5.
