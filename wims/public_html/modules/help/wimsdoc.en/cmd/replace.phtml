!replace `obj' `ident' by `s' in `string'
mean:String manipulation. <p>\
  Under the first syntax, variable substitution is first done on `string'.\
  Then all occurences of substring `s1' are replaced by `s2'. <br/>\
  When the keyword `internal' is absent, the Linux utility `sed' is called to make the replacements,\
  therefore regular expressions are accepted in `s1' and `s2'.\
  Please refer to the man page of `sed' for details. </p><p>\
  Under the second syntax, `obj' can be `char', `word', `item' or `line'.\
  Then the word, item or line identified by `ident' in `string' is replaced\
  by `s', after variable substitutions. <br/>\
  `ident' can be a string, in this case all objects (words, items or lines) matching `ident' \
  will be replaced. It can also be a number (positive or negative integer `n'), preceded\
  by the word `number'. In this case the object number `n' will be replaced.\
  (In the case where n&lt;0, it is the last -n th object which is replaced.)\
