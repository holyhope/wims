 If you disregard the very simplest cases, there is in all of 
mathematics not a single infinite series whose sum has been

 Bistromathics itself is simply a revolutionary new way of 
understanding the behavior of numbers. Just as Einstein observed that 
space was not an absolute but depended on the observer's movement in 
space, and that time was not an absolute, but depended on the 
observer's movement in time, so it is now realized that numbers are 
not absolute, but depend on the observer's movement in restaurants.

 The first nonabsolute number is the number of people for whom the 
table is reserved. This will vary during the course of the first 
three telephone calls to the restaurant, and then bear no apparent 
relation to the number of people who actually turn up, or to the 
number of people who subsequently join them after the 
show/match/party/gig, or to the number of people who leave when they 
see who else has turned up.
 The second nonabsolute number is the given time of arrival, which is 
now known to be one of the most bizarre of mathematical concepts, a 
recipriversexcluson, a number whose existence can only be defined as 
being anything other than itself. In other words, the given time of 
arrival is the one moment of time at which it is impossible that any 
member of the party will arrive.  Recipriversexclusons now play a 
vital part in many branches of math, including statistics and 
accountancy and also form the basic equations used to engineer the

abstract it. So that as tennis is a game of no use in itself, but of

looming ahead one of those terrible exercises in probability where 
six men have white hats and six men have black hats and you have to 
work it out by mathematics how likely it is that the hats will get 
mixed up and in what proportion. If you start thinking about things 
like that, you would go round the bend. Let me assure you of that!"

minus. I saw exactly why it happened and why the tergiversation was

 The mathematician may be compared to a designer of garments, who is 
utterly oblivious of the creatures whom his garments may fit. To be 
sure, his art originated in the necessity for clothing such 
creatures, but this was long ago; to this day a shape will 
occasionally appear which will fit into the garment as if the garment 
had been made for it. Then there is no end of surprise and delight.

 Neither in the subjective nor in the objective world can we find a 
criterion for the reality of the number concept, because the first 
contains no such concept, and the second contains nothing that is 
free from the concept. How then can we arrive at a criterion? Not by 
evidence, for the dice of evidence are loaded. Not by logic, for 
logic has no existence independent of mathematics: it is only one 
phase of this multiplied necessity that we call mathematics.
 How then shall mathematical concepts be judged? They shall not be 
judged.  Mathematics is the supreme arbiter. From its decisions there 
is no appeal.  We cannot change the rules of the game, we cannot 
ascertain whether the game is fair. We can only study the player at 
his game; not, however, with the detached attitude of a bystander, 
for we are watching our own minds at play.

its better solution. The third, to direct my thoughts in an orderly 
way; beginning with the simplest objects, those most apt to be known,

 I think that there is a moral to this story, namely that it is more

experiment.  If Schroedinger had been more confident of his work, he 
could have published it some months earlier, and he could have 
published a more accurate equation.  It seems that if one is working 
from the point of view of getting beauty in one's equations, and if 
one has really a sound insight, one is on a sure line of progress. If 
there is not complete agreement between the results of one's work and 
experiment, one should not allow oneself to be too discouraged, 
because the discrepancy may well be due to minor features that are 
not properly taken into account and that will get cleared up with 
further development of the theory.

 Euler, Leonhard (1707 - 1783)
 If a nonnegative quantity was so small that it is smaller than any 
given one, then it certainly could not be anything but zero. To those 
who ask what the infinitely small quantity in mathematics is, we 
answer that it is actually zero. Hence there are not so many 
mysteries hidden in this concept as they are usually believed to be. 
These supposed mysteries have rendered the calculus of the infinitely 
small quite suspect to many people.  Those doubts that remain we 
shall thoroughly remove in the following pages, where we shall 
explain this calculus.

 Mathematics is not only real, but it is the only reality. That is

of particles.  It's made of electrons and neutrons and protons. So 
the entire universe is made out of particles. Now what are the 
particles made out of? They're not made out of anything. The only 
thing you can say about the reality of an electron is to cite its 
mathematical properties. So there's a sense in which matter has 
completely dissolved and what is left is just a mathematical 
structure.

world "simplest." It is really an aesthetic canon such as we find 
implicit in our criticisms of poetry or painting. The layman finds 
such a law as dx/dt = K(d^2x/dy^2) much less simple than "it oozes," 
of which it is the mathematical statement. The physicist reverses 
this judgment, and his statement is certainly the more fruitful of 
the two, so far as prediction is concerned. It is, however, a 
statement about something very unfamiliar to the plainman, namely, 
the rate of change of a rate of change.

 The fact is that there are few more "popular" subjects than

as most people can enjoy a pleasant tune; and there are probably more 
people really interested in mathematics than in music. Appearances 
may suggest the contrary, but there are easy explanations. Music can 
be used to stimulate mass emotion, while mathematics cannot; and 
musical incapacity is recognized (no doubt rightly) as mildly 
discreditable, whereas most people are so frightened of the name of 
mathematics that they are ready, quite unaffectedly, to exaggerate 
their own mathematical stupidity.

to inhibit the flight of imagination. Therefore, a certain naivete,

 One of the big misapprehensions about mathematics that we perpetrate

interesting questions, and that teachers know those answers. And if 
one could get hold of the book, one would have everything settled.

 I do hate sums. There is no greater mistake than to call arithmetic 
an exact science. There are permutations and aberrations discernible 
to minds entirely noble like mine; subtle variations which ordinary 
accountants fail to discover; hidden laws of number which it requires 
a mind like mine to perceive. For instance, if you add a sum from the 
bottom up, and then from the top down, the result is always different.

 Most of the arts, as painting, sculpture, and music, have emotional 
appeal to the general public. This is because these arts can be 
experienced by some one or more of our senses. Such is not true of 
the art of mathematics; this art can be appreciated only by 
mathematicians, and to become a mathematician requires a long period 
of intensive training. The community of mathematicians is similar to 
an imaginary community of musical composers whose only satisfaction 
is obtained by the interchange among themselves of the musical scores 
they compose.

 There's a touch of the priesthood in the academic world, a sense 
that a scholar should not be distracted by the mundane tasks of 
day-to-day living.  I used to have great stretches of time to work. 
Now I have research thoughts while making peanut butter and jelly 
sandwiches. Sure it's impossible to write down ideas while reading 
"curious George" to a two-year-old.  On the other hand, as my husband 
was leaving graduate school for his first job, his thesis advisor 
told him, "You may wonder how a professor gets any research done when 
one has to teach, advise students, serve on committees, referee 
papers, write letters of recommendation, interview prospective

 It is India that gave us the ingenious method of expressing all

position as well as an absolute value; a profound and important idea 
which appears so simple to us now that we ignore its true merit. But 
its very simplicity and the great ease which it has lent to 
computations put our arithmetic in the first rank of useful 
inventions; and we shall appreciate the grandeur of the achievement

 How can you shorten the subject? That stern struggle with the

shoulder your way past quadratic equations or ripple through the

the tangled growth, your pace slackens, you sink and fall somewhere 
near the binomial theorem with the calculus in sight on the horizon.

 In presenting a mathematical argument the great thing is to give the 
educated reader the chance to catch on at once to the momentary point 
and take details for granted: his successive mouthfuls should be such 
as can be swallowed at sight; in case of accidents, or in case he 
wishes for once to check in detail, he should have only a clearly 
circumscribed little problem to solve (e.g. to check an identity: two 
trivialities omitted can add up to an impasse). The unpractised 
writer, even after the dawn of a conscience, gives him no such 
chance; before he can spot the point he has to tease his way through

 We come finally, however, to the relation of the ideal theory to

wants them he would say that the ideal system runs parallel to the 
usual theory:  "If this is what you want, try it: it is not my 
business to justify application of the system; that can only be done 
by philosophizing; I am a mathematician". In practice he is apt to 
say: "try this; if it works that will justify it". But now he is not

every page. Florence Nightingale believed -- and in all the actions 
of her life acted upon that belief -- that the administrator could 
only be successful if he were guided by statistical knowledge. The 
legislator -- to say nothing of the politician -- too often failed 
for want of this knowledge. Nay, she went further; she held that the 
universe -- including human communities -- was evolving in accordance 
with a divine plan; that it was man's business to endeavor to 
understand this plan and guide his actions in sympathy with it. But 
to understand God's thoughts, she held we must study statistics, for 
these are the measure of His purpose. Thus the study of statistics 
was for her a religious duty.

 Even fairly good students, when they have obtained the solution of 
the problem and written down neatly the argument, shut their books 
and look for something else. Doing so, they miss an important and 
instructive phase of the work. ... A good teacher should understand 
and impress on his students the view that no problem whatever is 
completely exhausted.
 One of the first and foremost duties of the teacher is not to give 
his students the impression that mathematical problems have little 
connection with each other, and no connection at all with anything 
else. We have a natural opportunity to investigate the connections of 
a problem when looking back at its solution.

 Time was when all the parts of the subject were dissevered, when 
algebra, geometry, and arithmetic either lived apart or kept up cold 
relations of acquaintance confined to occasional calls upon one 
another; but that is now at an end; they are drawn together and are 
constantly becoming more and more intimately related and connected by 
a thousand fresh ties, and we may confidently look forward to a time 
when they shall form but one body with one soul.

 The world of ideas which it [mathematics] discloses or illuminates, 
the contemplation of divine beauty and order which it induces, the 
harmonious connexion of its parts, the infinite hierarchy and 
absolute evidence of the truths with which it is concerned, these, 
and such like, are the surest grounds of the title of mathematics to 
human regard, and would remain unimpeached and unimpaired were the 
plan of the universe unrolled like a map at our feet, and the mind of 
man qualified to take in the whole scheme of creation at a glance.

 I know, indeed, and can conceive of no pursuit so antagonistic to 
the cultivation of the oratorical faculty ... as the study of 
Mathematics.  An eloquent mathematician must, from the nature of 
things, ever remain as rare a phenomenon as a talking fish, and it is 
certain that the more anyone gives himself up to the study of 
oratorical effect the less will he find himself in a fit state to 
mathematicize.

 Cell and tissue, shell and bone, leaf and flower, are so many

that their particles have been moved, moulded and conformed. They are 
no exceptions to the rule that God always geometrizes. Their problems 
of form are in the first instance mathematical problems, their 
problems of growth are essentially physical problems, and the

 He is not a true man of science who does not bring some sympathy to

application.  It is childish to rest in the discovery of mere

geometry is a petty and idle exercise of the mind, if it is applied 
to no larger system than the starry one.  Mathematics should be mixed 
not only with physics but with ethics; that is mixed mathematics. The 
fact which interests us most is the life of the naturalist. The 
purest science is still biographical.

 Perhaps the most surprising thing about mathematics is that it is so 
surprising. The rules which we make up at the beginning seem ordinary 
and inevitable, but it is impossible to foresee their consequences. 
These have only been found out by long study, extending over many 
centuries. Much of our knowledge is due to a comparatively few great 
mathematicians such as Newton, Euler, Gauss, or Riemann; few careers 
can have been more satisfying than theirs. They have contributed 
something to human thought even more lasting than great literature, 
since it is independent of language.

 Tolstoy, [Count] Lev Nikolgevich (1828-1920)
 A modern branch of mathematics, having achieved the art of dealing 
with the infinitely small, can now yield solutions in other more 
complex problems of motion, which used to appear insoluble. This 
modern branch of mathematics, unknown to the ancients, when dealing 
with problems of motion, admits the conception of the infinitely 
small, and so conforms to the chief condition of motion (absolute 
continuity) and thereby corrects the inevitable error which the human 
mind cannot avoid when dealing with separate elements of motion 
instead of examining continuous motion. In seeking the laws of 
historical movement just the same thing happens. The movement of 
humanity, arising as it does from innumerable human wills, is 
continuous. To understand the laws of this continuous movement is the 
aim of history. Only by taking an infinitesimally small unit for 
observation (the differential of history, that is, the individual

 For twenty pages perhaps, he read slowly, carefully, dutifully, with 
pauses for self-examination and working out examples. Then, just as 
it was working up and the pauses should have been more scrupulous 
than ever, a kind of swoon and ecstasy would fall on him, and he read 
ravening on, sitting up till dawn to finish the book, as though it 
were a novel. After that his passion was stayed; the book went back 
to the Library and he was done with mathematics till the next bout. 
Not much remained with him after these orgies, but something 
remained: a sensation in the mind, a worshiping acknowledgment of 
something isolated and unassailable, or a remembered mental joy at 
the rightness of thoughts coming together to a conclusion, accurate 
thoughts, thoughts in just intonation, coming together like 
unaccompanied voices coming to a close.

 Wren, Sir Christopoher
 In things to be seen at once, much variety makes confusion, another 
vice of beauty. In things that are not seen at once, and have no 
respect one to another, great variety is commendable, provided this 
variety transgress not the rules of optics and geometry.

 X, Malcom
 I'm sorry to say that the subject I most disliked was mathematics.  
I have thought about it. I think the reason was that mathematics 
leaves no room for argument. If you made a mistake, that was all 
there was to it.

 Young, J. W. A.
 Mathematics has beauties of its own -- a symmetry and proportion in 
its results, a lack of superfluity, an exact adaptation of means to 
ends, which is exceedingly remarkable and to be found only in the 
works of the greatest beauty When this subject is properly ... 
presented, the mental emotion should be that of enjoyment of beauty, 
not that of repulsion from the ugly and the unpleasant.
