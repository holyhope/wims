<tt>all</tt> for the parameter  <tt> number of dat sets used in each step </tt>.
The exercise will therefore not be random and may be repetitive for the learner.

and an audio recording of the item.

you have to tick the language you are going to use. This function cannot yet be 
used with all the different types of exercises (however, in certain exercise types check the "preferences" 
section to see how words from the audio collection can be included by adding <tt>audio="word"</tt> 
at the beginning of the data set. If the word is to be included from the swac audio collection, 
the extension <tt>.mp3</tt>should not be specified.)
