The system includes several facilities allowing you to create and develop
WIMS activities directly online. To do so, you have only to click on the
respective links from the home page of the server.

The easiest is the creation of $emph simple interactive exercises $emphend
which does not really require the knowledge about a computer language, but
exercises that can be written in this way have limited power and versatility.
<p>
On the other hand, you can also develop $emph full-power WIMS modules$emphend
by working entirely on line. For obvious security reasons, you will need a
login/password pair which you must ask the site manager to attribute to you.
Once logged in, you can create and modify as many modules as you like, in a
special development zone. When you have finished the development of a
module, you can ask the site manager to move it to a public place.
