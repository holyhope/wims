A sheet of exercises is a gathering of exercises on a given subject. It
reflects a certain teaching goal, and can be used in an environment of virtual
classes for the purpose of control students' progress.
<p>
This database contains a collection of publically accessible exercise sheets.
You can freely test your knowledge on any of them, or if you are the
supervisor of a virtual class, insert some of them into your class.
