One of the big features of WIMS is that it allows anybody to create his/her
own exercises directly through the web browser.
<p>
Such an exercise created online is under OEF format (OEF: Online Exercise
Format). This format does not contain WIMS-specific information, and may be
used on any exercise system which accepts it.
<p>
Although OEF exercises do not exploit the full power offered by WIMS, they
are sufficiently versatile in most cases: you can put random parameters 
(random numbers, functions, text...) into such an exercise, and make 
complicated processes on them (differentiation, integration, evaluation,...).
Answers can be multiple choices with one or more correct answers, numerical
or functional input, or a mixture of them. You can even set up specific
conditions to analyze the answers, instead of comparing them with a standard
answer (so that for example exercises with infinitely many correct answers can be
created).
<p>
If you have set up a
!href module=$module&chapter=3 virtual class
, you can create exercises for your class and put them into 
!href module=$module&chapter=3&open=$open,3_sheet#sheet worksheets
 so that your students can work on them and get
!href module=$module&chapter=1&open=$open,1_exo#exo scored
 for their works, giving you full control of their progress.
<p>
The online creation of exercises is done through the utility
!href module=adm/createxo Createxo
, which contains more detailed help pages about the format and syntax of
OEF exercises.
