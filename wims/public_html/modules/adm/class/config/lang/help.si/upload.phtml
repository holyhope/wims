<b>Upload a class backup</b>. <br>
There are principally two occasions when you need to upload a backup file
onto the server.
<p>
The first case is when your class is dammaged for one reason or the other.
In this case, we recommend a restoration as complete as possible (except
class configuration and supervisor account if they are not dammaged).
Due to the inter-dependences of different types of resources in the class,
a partial restoration will probably not work. And of course, you must use a
backup of YOUR class, but not that of another one.
<p>
The second case is when you want to install resources downloaded from
another class into yours. This should only be done when your class is empty,
at the beginning of its setup. And you should respect the
!href cmd=help&special_parm=dependencies resource dependencies
. A basic rule here is that you do not restore participant activity
register, and that interactive teaching resources (documents, exercises, worksheets 
and exam sheets) should never be restored from several different sources.
