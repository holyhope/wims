Here we give some details of the activity statistics of the one-semester course during academic year 2000-2001.

Here the basic accounting unit is ``exercise unit'', corresponding to one item in a worksheet. The actual size of this unit varies from item to item, and is determined when the exercise is inserted to the worksheet. Roughly, one exercise unit usually corresponds to one exercise whose answer requires several steps of computation, or one exercise whose solution consists of multiple interactive steps, or several exercises with simple answers.

Interested reader may take a look at the worksheets to get a more precise idea of this unit size as well as the difficulty level.To get a list of the publicly accessible worksheets, just make a search for the words `unsa 2001' for worksheets in WIMS home page.

During the one-semester course, a total number of 448 student accounts have been created, corresponding to 376 students (some students have created multiple accounts), including inactive students.
