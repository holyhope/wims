slib_title=Draw a solution of a differential system: x'=f1(t,x,y), y=f2(t,x,y)\
x and y as functions of t and (x,y) in the plane (x,y).

slib_out=Draw the solution for t > 0 of x'(t)=f1(t,x,y) , y'(t)=f2(t,x,y) through (x0,y0) at t=0\
in the planes (t,x/y) and (x,y) (in the case where f1 is different from 1).\
f1 and f2 may depend on sliders.

slib_comment=Use jsxgraph. The jsxgraph programm comes from an example on the website of jsxgraph. \
 For the moment, two such outputs in the same html page are not allowed.
