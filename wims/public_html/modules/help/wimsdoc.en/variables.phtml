<h4>Definition and substitution of variables</h4>

Wims variables has only one type: they are all string variables. Numerical
evaluation can be done on variables via the variable command 
$(ref1)cmdlist_eval_&+cmd_choose=all$(ref2)cmdlist_eval_">!eval</a>.
<p>
A variable may be defined or modified in a variable processing file, or by
the commands 
$(ref1)cmdlist_let_&+cmd_choose=all$(ref2)cmdlist_let_">!let</a> and
$(ref1)cmdlist_default_&+cmd_choose=all$(ref2)cmdlist_default_">!default</a>.
<p>
Variable names can contain any alphanumeric character, as well as the
underscore character $(emph)_$emphend. There is a limit to the length of
variable names, and a limit to the length of values. (Limits depending on
server configuration.)
<p>
Variable substitution can be done anywhere in a variable processing file or
a phtml file (even in the name field of a variable definition
line). A word preceeded by the character $emph$$$emphend
is considered to be a variable name, and will be replaced by its value when
the line containing it is processed.
<p>
Special rules of variable substitution:
<ul>
 <li>If the character $emph$$$emphend is followed by a space, it will be
  discarded.
 <li>The string $emph$$$$$emphend is replaced by a single $emph$$$emphend.
 <li>If the character $emph$$$emphend is followed by the left parenthesis
  $emph($emphend, the matching $emph)$emphend will be located, the content
  of the pair of parentheses substituted. The result of the substitution
  will then be used as the name of variable, and finally the whole thing
  will be replaced by the value of the last variable. This allows nested
  substitutions, as well as substitution of a variable which is followed
  by an alphanumeric character.
  <br>Example: if the variable $(emph)i$emphend has value $(emph)3$emphend
  and the variable $(emph)alpha3beta$emphend has value $(emph)pi$emphend,
  the string<pre>
  3*$$(alpha$$(i)beta)*x</pre>will become<pre>
  3*pi*x</pre>after substitution.
  <p>
  Array addressing: if the variable $(emph)l$emphend contains a
  comma-separated list $(emph)a,b,c,d,e$emphend, then the string
  <tt>$$(i[3])</tt> gives <tt>c</tt> after substitution, and
  <tt>$$(i[2 to 4])</tt> tives <tt>b,c,d</tt>, etc.
  <p>
  Two-dimensional array addressing is also available: if
  <p><center><tt>$$M=x,y,z;a,b,c</tt>
  </center> <p>
  (a 2x3 matrix), then
  <p><center>
  <tt> $$(M[1;3,2])=z,y </tt>
  </center> <li><p>If the character $emph$$$emphend is followed by the left bracket
  $emph[$emphend, the matching $emph]$emphend will be located, the content
  of the pair of brackets substituted then evaluated to a real number value whose
  precision depends on the value of $emph print_precision$emphend.
  This value will replace the whole thing
  together with the leading $emph$$$emphend. <br>
  It can be used for array subscripts.
  <br>Example: if the variable $(emph)i$emphend has value $(emph)3$emphend
  and the variables <br>
  $(emph)a1$emphend has value $(emph)3$emphend and <br>
  $(emph)a2$emphend has value $(emph)pi$emphend, <br>
  then the string<pre>
  $$(a$$[$$i-1])*x+$$(a$$[$$i-2])</pre>will become<pre>
  pi*x+3</pre>after substitution.
 <li>If the value of a variable being substituted contains the character 
  $emph$$$emphend, this value will again be substituted, until no more
  substitution is needed. The server has a built-in limit of nested
  substitutions; infinite nested substitions will violate this limit and
  generate an error message.
</ul>

<hr><h4>Reserved variable names</h4>

The following names are reserved for their special meanings. They should not be
used for internal needs of any module.

<ul>
 <li>Do not use variables with names consisting only of numbers. They are
  reserved for future enhancements of the language.
 <li>Variables named
  !for i in cmd,module,session,lang,special_parm,user,useropts,worksheet
   $emph$i$emphend,
  !next i
  are reserved for special parameter passing by the user. A module's variable
  processing files or phtml files can read but cannot set them. <br>
  Refer to the section $emph$title_structure$emphend for the meaning of
  these variables.
 <li>The variable $emph no_name$emphend has a special use: <br>
  Parameters in the user query string with no name (for example when the
  coordinate of a mappable image is passed this way to the http server) will
  be registered under this variable. For this reason, it should not be used
  for other purposes.
 <li>All variable names starting with $emph wims_$emphend will have special
  meanings for wims server. A module should read or write them only for the
  special meanings they are designed for.
 <li>Variable names starting with $emph m_$emphend are reserved for inline
  mathematical fonts. The module programmer may redefine them, but then their
  original meaning will be lost.
 <li>The variable $emph module_dir$emphend has a value preset to the directory
  of the current module (with respect to the public home directory of the
  server). This value is usually $emph $$module_dir=module/$$module $emphend
  (but may vary with the config of the installation).
 <li>Variable names starting with $emph module_$emphend will have special 
  meanings: they are used to hold variables defined in the module's INDEX
  file. Currently implemented variables:

  $table_header
  $table_tr<th> Variables</th><th>Meaning</th></tr>
   $table_tr<td>$emph module_title$emphend<td>title of the module
   $table_tr<td>$emph module_description$emphend<td>short description of the module
   $table_tr<td>$emph module_author$emphend<td>name(s) of author(s) of the module
   $table_tr<td>$emph module_address$emphend<td>e-mail address of the (principal) author
   $table_tr<td>$emph module_copyright$emphend<td>copyright notice of the module
   $table_tr<td>$emph module_version$emphend<td>current version of the module
   $table_tr<td>$emph module_wims_version$emphend<td>minimal wims version required<br>
   	to run this module
   $table_tr<td>$emph module_language$emphend<td>language of the module<br>(en, fr, de, or ...)
   $table_tr<td>$emph module_category$emphend<td>category of the module<br>
   	(exercise, tool, course, pedia, recreation, adm, other)
   $table_tr<td>$emph module_level$emphend<td>level of the module
   $table_tr<td>$emph module_domain$emphend<td>algebra, analysis, geometry, ...
   $table_tr<td>$emph module_keywords$emphend<td>keywords, to be placed in the html header
   $table_tr<td>$emph module_scoring$emphend<td>= yes if the module gives scores according
   	to wims standard
  </table></center>
  Also, variables $emph module_has_intro$emphend, 
  $emph module_has_help$emphend and
  $emph module_has_about$emphend
  have value "yes" if the module's directory contains the respective
  .phtml file. These variables are used in the command <tt>!homeref</tt>.
 <li>Certain environment variables setup by httpd are readable by wims
  modules under names starting with $emph httpd_$emphend. For example, the
  environment variable $emph REMOTE_HOST$emphend becomes 
  $emph httpd_REMOTE_HOST$emphend under wims. <br>
  Please refer to httpd protocol specifications for details of such variables.
 <li>All variable names starting with $emph ins_$emphend, $emph
  insplot_$emphend, $emph instex_$emphend will have special meanings for the
  corresponding dynamic insertion engines. A module should read or write them
  only for the special meanings they are designed for.
 <li>If your module uses an external package (e.g. $emph pari$emphend),
  variable names starting with the name of the interface to that external
  package followed by $emph _$emphend will have special meanings for that
  interface, and should be reserved for that purpose.
</ul>
