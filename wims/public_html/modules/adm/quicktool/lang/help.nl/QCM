$wims_name_quick_QCM is a traditional Multiple Choice Questionnaire type exercise.
You can decide how many steps the exercise shall have and the number of questions 
you wish to ask in each step (by default the number of steps is 1).
There may be one or several correct answers to each question, in this latter 
case the <tt>checkbox</tt> format should be selected. The answer to a question 
which has several correct answers is counted as wrong unless all the answers have been provided.

<p class="emptyline"></p>
You can decide to provide the correct answers to the questions or simply indicate 
which answers are correct and which ones are wrong.
<p class="emptyline"></p>
In an exercise which is composed of several steps you can decide what percentage 
of correct answers are required before the learner can continue the exercise (i.e. go on to the next step). The learner will therefore not be encouraged to click thoughtlessly simply in order to have access to the correct answer.

Feedback, which will be available with the score, can be provided for each question.
