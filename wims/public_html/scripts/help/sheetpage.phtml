<H3><center>Using a document block for worksheet presentation</center></H3>

You may put the address of a document block
(such as <tt>c1/main</tt>) to be the presentation page of the work sheet.
The document itself need not be readable by participants.
<p>
Leave this field blank if you want to use the standard presentation page.
<p>
Links to individual exercises should be defined using the command
<tt>\exercise</tt>.
You can use the following pre-defined variables:<ul>
 <li><tt>\scorerequire</tt> Required points of each exercise
 <li><tt>\scoregot</tt> Participant's point achievements on each exercise
 <li><tt>\scoremean</tt> Participant's average score on each exercise
 <li><tt>\expiration</tt> Expiration date of the sheet, yyyymmdd
 <li><tt>\today</tt> Date of today, yyyymmdd
</ul>
All the score parameters are lists of numbers, each member of the list
corresponding to the number for an exercise of the sheet.
