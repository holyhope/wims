This variant of SELECTWORD presents a piece of text and requires the learner to 
provide <b>successively</b> an "explanation" i.e. a correction, a translation, etc. 


<ul><li> You can decide which format you wish to use(clickfill, case, dragfill).
</li><li> The feedback (correct answers) to the exercise can be displayed either 
in the text beside the word(s) or between the lines or outside the text.

</li></ul>


<p> The size of the blanks or labels in the second phase of the exercise have 
to be configured according to the length of the "explanation" required.

The syntax to be used in this variant is the same as the syntax in the 
SELECTWORD type of exercise.
Several data sets can be included in an exercise but they will be displayed randomly .
If several answers are possible, separate them with ||.


<p>A different picture, audio recording, introduction or title (i.e. piece of text) 
can be added to each data set.
