A <em>natural number</em> is an element of the set
$m_NN={0,1,2,...}.
<p>
An <em>integer</em> is either a natural number, or its negative.
The set of integers is $m_ZZ.
<p>
One can complete $m_ZZ to the set $m_QQ of <em>rational numbers</em>
by introducing fractions of integers.
<p>
Then one completes $m_QQ to the set $m_RR of <em>real numbers</em>
by introducing finite limits.
<p>
And $m_RR is completed to $m_CC, the set of <em>complex numbers</em>,
by adding roots of polynomials.
<p>
Conclusion&#58;<br><center>
 $m_NN $m_subset $m_ZZ $m_subset $m_QQ $m_subset $m_RR $m_subset $m_CC
