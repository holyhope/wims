Discussions in a classroom are an important ingredient of teaching. By participating in a discussion, students think actively and therefore get a deeper understanding of the subject.
<p>
In a virtual classroom environment, such discussions may be simulated by the various communication facilities (message boards, documents, individual messages). In fact, this simulation has its advantages over real-classroom discussions&#58;
<p>
In a written discussion, students have more time to think, resulting in deeper discussions. Also, the written archives can help everybody, including those who did not participate actively, to follow the discussion.
<p>
Discussions in WIMS virtual classes can be carried out in two different ways.<ol>
<p>
<li>In discussion forums.<br>
The teacher can ask a question to start the discussion, by posting a message to the class forum. Students give answers to the question by posting followup messages. This is suitable for subjects with bulky comments/answers, or those for which a large number of participations are anticipated.
<p>
<li>In class documents.<br>
The teacher can create a document, and configure it so that students can post comments to (but not to modify) it.
<p>
</ol>
<p>
In order to encourage student participation in the discussions, it is recommended that student participations be graded, with each pertinent answer/comment giving rise to a certain number of points to its author(s).
