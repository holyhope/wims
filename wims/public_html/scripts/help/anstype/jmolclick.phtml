<b>Select atoms in 3D</b> (java required) (name: <span class="tt wims_code_words">jmolclick</span>)
<p>
A molecule is showed in the <b>Jmol</b> applet and some atoms must be selected.
This reply type must be used in link with the command <span class="tt wims_code_words">\embed{}</span>.
Other objects than molecule can be represented according to the capacity of 
<b>Jmol</b>.
</p><p>
The good answer has two lignes (separated by  ; ) : the first one is the
good answer, the seconde one is the molecule to show: the structure file (in a valid
format for <b>Jmol</b>) can be in a directory <span class="tt wims_fname">data</span> of the module,
in the data directory of the distribution WIMS (address <span class="tt wims_fname">data/xxx</span>) or
in a data module in <span class="tt wims_fname">modules/data</span> (in this case, the address is of the form
<span class="tt wims_fname">datamodule/xxx</span>) or in the directory <span class="tt wims_fname">images</span> (the address is then <span class="tt wims_fname">\imagedir/xxx</span>).
One can also put directly the structure of the molecule.
</p><p>
The first part of the good answer is given by
the list of atom numbers to select (as they are in the structure file) or by a command in the 
<b>Jmol</b> syntax (some examples are given below). So, <span class="tt wims_code_words">1, 2, 3</span> is equivalent to
<span class="tt wims_code_words">atomno=1 or atomno=2 or atomno=3</span> or to <span class="tt wims_code_words">({0,1,2})</span> (the two last forms are in
<b>Jmol</b> syntax).
</p><p>
Several good answers may be given ; they must be separated by a <span class="tt wims_code_words">|||</span>


Warning : if <span class="tt wims_code_words">no_select=2</span>, <span class="tt wims_code_words">_O ||| 1|2|4</span> means that one must select exactly two oxygen atoms or 
two atoms amongst 1, 2 et 4. 

The first line of the command <span class="tt wims_code_words">\embed</span> is the size X x Y (in pixels) of the applet. 
On the next three lines, <b>Jmol</b> scripts (cf <a href="http://chemapps.stolaf.edu/jmol/docs/">Jmol documentation</a>) can be given : the first one is executed at the first request
of the exercise, the third one is executed when the answer is send, the second one is used in both cases.

One can also give the address of a file containing a script. The rules are the same as in the case of the
structure of the molecule (<span class="tt wims_fname">data/scriptsimple.spt</span>). To be valid,
the file must have <span class="tt">.spt</span> as extension. When this script is created by the 
exercise (for example, it contains random variables) one can also use
the slib <span class="tt">oef/newfile</span> (example : 
<pre>\text{filescript=slib(oef/newfile spt,\text_script)}</pre>
where the variable <span class="tt wims_code_words">text_script</span> contains the script.
It gives the url address of the created file.

</p><b>Example</b>: 
<pre>
\text{filescript=wims(record 0 of data/scriptsimple.spt)}
\text{filescript=slib(oef/newfile spt,\filescript)}
\statement{
  \embed{r1, 300x300
  script \filescript ; select ({5}); spacefill 0.1;select none;
  set echo top left; echo "before the answer";
  set echo bottom right; echo "after the answer";}
}
</pre>
or
<pre>
\text{filescript=wims(record 0 of data/scriptsimple.spt)}
\text{filescript=slib(oef/newfile spt,\filescript)}
\statement{
  \embed{r1, 300x300
  \filescript}
}
</pre>
<p>
Do not forget the semi-colons of Jmolscript.

The score takes in account a partially good answer and the weight of bad answers are greater than the

the atoms in the list can not be selected.

$table_end

The variable <span class="tt wims_code_words">reply</span>n has three lists separated by semi-colons :
the list of the good answers of the students; the list of his/her bad  answers; the list of the forgotten
atoms.

In the case where the first field of the good answer is an empty variable, the variable
<span class="tt wims_code_words">reply</span>n is simply the list of the selected atoms.
