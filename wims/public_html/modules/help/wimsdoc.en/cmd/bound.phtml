  $(lst_syntax)bound $emph vname$emphend between [integer]
  $emph v1$emphend and $emph v2$emphend [default $emph defaultvalue$emphend]
  </tt> <br>or<br><tt>
  $!bound $emph vname$emphend within $emph list$emphend [default
  $emph defaultvalue$emphend]</tt>
  $lst_mean bound the range of the variable $emph vname$emphend. Usually
  this is used on user-submitted variables. <br>
  The first syntax is usually for numerical variables (integer or real,
  defaults to real). In this case $emph v1$emphend and $emph v2$emphend 
  supplies the lower and upper bounds for the value of $emph
  vname$emphend. <br>
  In the second syntax, the value of $emph vname $emphend is compared with
  each item of $emph list$emphend. If no occurrence is found, the value of
  $emph vname$emphend is replaced either by $emph defaultvalue$emphend or
  the first item of $emph list$emphend, according to whether $emph 
  defaultvalue$emphend is defined. <br>
  In any case, $emph defaultvalue$emphend is optional.
