Addressing convention of WIMS modules

Activity modules should have an address of type
<span class="tt wims_fname">Zone/category/name.lang</span>
This is translated to
<span class="tt wims_fname">Zone~category~name.lang</span>
when the module is under development.

<ul>
<li><span class="tt wims_fname">Zone</span>: this is limited to the allowed zones of the system. Among them,
those with a upper-case letter followed by a number are zones corresponding
to academic levels,
<span class="tt wims_fname">Lang</span>
corresponds to language-learning materials,
<span class="tt wims_fname">tool</span>
contains various online tools,
<span class="tt wims_fname">local</span>
are modules that will only be used on the local server,
<span class="tt wims_fname">test</span>
is a non-publishable testing zone in which you can put anything you like.

</li><li><span class="tt wims_fname">category</span>: this could be any word of your choice, but when you submit
the module for publication, it will be accepted only if the category is
known to the system.
<p>
Please look at the categories of existing modules for the possibilities.
In case of doubt, please write to the
!mailurl $sysadmin publication coordinator
.
</p>
</li><li><span class="tt wims_fname">name</span>: any word of your choice, preferably between 4 and 12 lower-case characters.

</li><li><span class="tt wims_fname">lang</span>: The two-character language code of the module. Must be within the languages
supported by the site ($wims_site_languages), and should be equal to the language defined in the
module's INDEX file.
