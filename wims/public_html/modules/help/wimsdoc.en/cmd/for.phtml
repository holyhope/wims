mean:For loop. In the first two forms, `var' goes from `start' to `end', with optional step `st'.\
  <br/>In the last form, `var' takes successively items in the list\
  `list'. `list' is a list of items separated by commas. <br/>\
  The command <pre>!break</pre>\
  within the for loop breaks it. `continue' is not yet implemented in this version. <br/>\
  It is recommended that the variable name `var' be added to the\
  <span class="tt">!next </span> line. This has no effect for the time being, but may be\
  used in future versions of wims.
