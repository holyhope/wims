WIMS is an open system, which is free to all and accepts contributions from
everyone. It is my hope that contributions from users will
considerably enrich the system and finally make it an important tool for
the mathematical community.

By using WIMS in the following advanced way, you will help yourself while
help the development of the system (hence help others) in the mean time.
