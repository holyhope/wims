Servers for downloads and publication 

!!publishname=Nice University Publication Center
!!downloadname=Nice University Download Center
!set subject=Publication
!set unice=!defof publishname,sysadmin in

!set wimsedu=!defof publishname,sysadmin in
wimshome/public_html/bases/sys/publishcenter/wimsedu

Two WIMS servers $(unice[1]) (<tt>unice</tt> 
<a href="mailto:$(unice[2])?subject=$subject">$(unice[2])</a>) et 
$(wimsedu[1]) (<tt>wimsedu</tt> <a href="mailto:$(wimsedu[2])?subject=$subject">$(wimsedu[2])</a>)
are available if you wish to download or publish modules.
The servers are synchronised if their version is compatible with the WIMS version required 
for the publication of a given module.
If a module published on a server is not compatible with the version of WIMS on a server, 
the address of the module is saved so as to avoid the publication of another module 
with the same address.

<p>
An author must be registered on one of the publication servers before he/she can publish a module.
Otherwise a module can only be published via a registered author who is first 
required to validate the module for publication.
</p>

<p>
A WIMS server administrator decides which publication server(s) to use 
and informs the authors who use his/her server to develop modules.
</p>
<p>
When a module is published on a server its author
has the right to modify it on the server it was published on.
If for some valid reason (for example a more recent version of WIMS),
the author wishes to to change the publication server for a module,
she/he has to contact the administrators of publication servers to require authorisation. 
</p>

<p> The administrator of a WIMS server can choose the servers 
from which he/she wishes to download modules from.
</p>
<p>
In the future, other publication and download servers may be 
added. A publication server is a center for downloads but the opposite is not always true.
