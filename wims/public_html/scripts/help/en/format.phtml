<center><h3>The formats of the statement</h3></center> <p>

You can write the statement of the exercise under one of two formats: html or
TeX. Thanks to the recent development of the capacities of the html format,
TeX format is no longer very useful, and should be avoided.
<p>
If your exercise does not contain complicated mathematical formulae 
(for example matrices), it is highly recommended to use the html format.
The execution will be faster, and there will be less problems of
compatibility, particularly in the future.
<p>
You can use the html format, if the statement of the exercise only contains
simple text. But you should take care to replace all appearences of the sign
<tt class="wims_code_words">&lt;</tt> by the string <tt class="wims_code_words">&#38;lt;</tt>, to avoid it to be interpreted
as the opening of an html tag. Otherwise, html tags can be used in the text,
particularly those for the subscripts (<tt class="wims_code_words">&lt;sub&gt;</tt> and <tt class="wims_code_words">&lt;/sub&gt;</tt>)
and superscripts
(<tt class="wims_code_words">&lt;sup&gt;</tt> and <tt class="wims_code_words">&lt;/sup&gt;</tt>).
<p>In particular, http links can be inserted into the statement. For
example, one can include figures in the exercise, without having to submit
these figures to the server. (You have only to declare the source of the
figure by a complete web address.)
<p>
You can also include mathematical symbols and formulas
!href cmd=help&special_parm=math very easily
 into your exercise even if it is in html format. If this still doesn't
satisfy you, the TeX format is available.
To use this format, you have to know the syntax of TeX.
<p>
Under html format, you may also embed
!href cmd=help&special_parm=embedans answers
 and
!href cmd=help&special_parm=draw dynamic pictures
 in your statement.
<p>
Remark also that the other fields of the exercise (prompts of replies,
hint and solution) only accept html format. Mathematical symbols and
formulas can be embedded into hint and solution as in the statement under
html format.
