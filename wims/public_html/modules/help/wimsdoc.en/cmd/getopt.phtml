  $lst_mean This command allows to extract the definition of a word in
  $emph string$emphend under the form $emph name=value$emphend.
  <p>
  It returns the defined $emph value$emphend in the string, or the
  $emph name$emphend itself if it appears in $emph string$emphend but
  if there is no $emph =$emphend sign following it, or an empty string
  if $emph name$emphend does not appear in $emph string$emphend as a word.
  <p>
  $emph value$emphend can be a multi-word string, if it is enclosed by a
  pair of parentheses, brackets, curly braces or double quotes. The enclosing
  parentheses etc. will be removed from the output.
  <p>
  Spaces are allowed before and/or after the $emph =$emphend sign.
