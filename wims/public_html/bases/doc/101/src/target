Call a WIMS module (exercise, tool, doc, administration): up to 2 arguments.<ul>
  <li>Argument 1: adress of the module (character strings in the URL
  after <tt>.../wims.cgi?</tt>&nbsp;; but you can also copy
  the entire adress). To insure the correct working of the link, please avoid
  using addresses containing a string
  <tt>cmd=reply</tt> or <tt>cmd=resume</tt>.
  <li>Argument 2 (optional): the text of the link. By default, this text will
  be the title of the called module.
 </ul>
 The called module will be brought up in another window of the browser, except for the command <tt>\\adm</tt>.
<p>For example, <tt>\\exercise{module=U1/analysis/graphder}{this}</tt>
or
<tt>\\exercise{http://wims.cgi?module=U1/analysis/graphder}{this}</tt>
gives \exercise{module=U1/analysis/graphder}{this}. (Both formulas are OK.)

<tt>\\tool{module=tool/algebra/factor}</tt>
gives \tool{module=tool/algebra/factor}.

<tt>\\help{module=help/main}{this help window}</tt>
opens \help{module=help/main}{this help window}.

<b>Remark</b>. For a document within a virtual class, if you write
<tt>\\exercise{3/2}</tt>, it is the second exercise of worksheet 3 that will popup, with the usual user scoring system.

However, this is limited to exercises without score dependencies, and you should make sure that the exercise you refer to is really accessible by the readers.
