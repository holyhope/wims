Documents on WIMS adopt a very convenient method to include
mathematical formulas.

The server uses the character `<font color=blue>\\</font>'
to detect when you want it to interpret what you type as a mathematical
symbol or formula. The rule is as follows.

If you want to write a <tt>\\</tt> in your message and want to have it shown as a
backslash, you should type it twice: <tt>\\\\</tt>.

If you simply want to insert some mathematical symbols or greek letters into
your document, you just need to type a <tt>\\</tt> followed by the name of
the symbol or greek letter. For example, <tt>\\pi</tt> gives you \pi,
<tt>\\le</tt> gives \le, <tt>\\pm</tt> gives \pm, <tt>\\rightarrow</tt> gives
\rightarrow, etc. The names of the symbols follow the standard TeX
convention. Here is a
\help{module=help/wimsdoc.en&subject=mathfonts#mathfonts}{liste}
 (replace <tt>$m_</tt> by <tt>\\</tt> in the names).

More generally, to insert a whole mathematical formula into the document, you
can type the formula in the usual way as if you enter it into any
mathematical software or any computational tool under WIMS. In order to make
the formula formatted and shown beautifully by the message board, you have
only to enclose it in a pair of parentheses preceded by a backslash
<tt>\\</tt>. For
example, <tt>&#92;(x^3-3x+cos(2pi*x)^5)</tt> gives you
\(x^3-3*x+cos(2pi*x)^5), or <tt>&#92;(sqrt(x^2+y^2))</tt> gives you
\(sqrt(x^2+y^2)). You can type <tt>&#92;(integrate(x^2+1)dx)</tt> for
\(integrate(x^2+1)*dx), or <tt>&#92;(integrate(exp(x^2+1),x=1..infinity))</tt> for
\(integrate(exp(x^2+1),x=1..infinity)). You can also write the sum
\(sum(1/n^2,n=1..infinity)) using <tt>&#92;(sum(1/n^2,n=1..infinity)</tt>,
or the product
\(product(n/(n+1),n=1..infinity))
 using <tt>&#92;(product(n/(n+1),n=1..infinity)</tt>.

More helps on how to enter mathematical expressions are in 
\help{module=help/main&chapter=1&open=1_math#math}{this page}.

To show a matrix
\([1,2,3;4,5,6;7,8,9]),
you should type <tt>&#92;([1,2,3;4,5,6;7,8,9])</tt>. Nested matrices are 
accepted (and will be formatted correctly).

For experts in TeX or LaTeX, please notice that whenever your formula to be
formatted contains characters `\\' that do not precede defined variables or
known commands, the entire formula will be interpreted as TeX source without
transformation, and be directly fed to TeX for rendering. Thus you are allowed
to write very sophisticated formulas if you know how to write them in TeX.

Finally, the preview button in the document editing page allows you to
check whether the formula you entered will be shown correctly.
